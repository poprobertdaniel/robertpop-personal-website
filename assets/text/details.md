## 📃

## I like to write **tech articles** as well as **non-tech articles**.

## 💻

## Also I like to share **personal experiences**, sharing my point of view while trying to **develop** **different products** or **little projects**.

## 💹

## At the same time I'm more and more interested about **marketing** and **content**.

## 🌊

## Applying **fluid thinking** for creating **product stories**, **addictive products**, **product market fit** and so on...

## I'm trying to improve on **public speaking** by **holding meetups** and **presentations**. My last talk was about **JS Frameworks** at **Codecamp Cluj**.

## Love participating into **local meetups** while also holding some.

## Latest meetup was based on **React** in the [React Cluj meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/reactcluj/). Other meetups included **end-to-end testing** with **Cypress**.

## 👨‍🏫

## I enjoy **teaching** about **Javascript** and all related to it. Now I am a **mentor** at [carmel](https://carmel.io) and recently joined NodeSchool Cluj's event.

## Other **topics** that I show an interest are: **bots**, **end-to-end testing**, **cloud**, **nodeJS**, **devops** and **graphql**.

## You can find some of my projects **<a href='https://github.com/robipop22' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>here</a>**.

## I'll try lately to **tweet more** and **write more** technical or non-technical **articles**.

## 🤘

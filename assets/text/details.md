## I like to write **articles** related to **technology** and **fun projects** I've been trying to do.

## I'll try to write out more about **marketing** and **fluid thinking** lately.

## Also I'm trying to improve on **public speaking** by **holding meetups** and **presentations**. Recently talked about **JS Frameworks** at **Codecamp Cluj**.

## Latest meetup was based on **React** in the [React Cluj meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/reactcluj/). Other meetups included **end-to-end testing** with **Cypress**.

## I enjoy **teaching** about **Javascript** and all related to it. Now I am a **mentor** at [carmel](https://carmel.io) and recently joined NodeSchool Cluj event.

## Other **topics** that I approached are: **bots**, **end-to-end testing**, **cloud**, **nodeJS**, **devops** and **graphql**.

## You can find some of my projects **<a href='https://github.com/robipop22' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>here</a>**.

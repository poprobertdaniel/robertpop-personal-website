# Welcome! ðŸ™Œ

## I started my coding journey in the **summer of 2015** (before I only did coding in highschool and a bit in the first year of college).

## I am a **tech enthusiast**, **JavaScript addict** with a **creative mindset**.

## I am always **seeking new challenges**. I mostly like to **stretch** the **limits of JavaScript** and **new technologies**, generally speaking.
